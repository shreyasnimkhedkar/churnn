Churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product or service in the future.  
Businesses use data analysis and machine learning techniques to anticipate customer behavior based on factors like purchase  
history, engagement patterns, and feedback. By accurately predicting churn, companies can take proactive stepsâ€”like personalized  
offers or improved customer serviceâ€”to retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss.
